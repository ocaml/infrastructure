Going forward, we will be publishing updates to the [OCaml
Changelog](https://ocaml.org/changelog), under the ['infrastructure'
tag](https://ocaml.org/changelog?t=infrastructure). This aggregation of
communications reflects the critical role of the infrastructure in supporting
the ocaml ecosystem, and we expect it to improve dissemination by reducing the
number of streams interested readers need to monitor. We have a basket of
(overdue) updates to announce, so be on the lookout for that in your browser or
RSS reader!
